Project Description
ASHify: A Splay Tree-Based Music Player with HTML Interface
Project Overview:
ASHify is an innovative music player application that integrates a splay tree data structure to efficiently manage and search a collection of songs. The project utilizes C++ for backend splay tree operations and generates a user-friendly HTML interface for frontend interactions. The HTML interface is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, allowing users to easily browse, search, and play songs.

Key Features:

Splay Tree Integration:

Implements a splay tree to store and manage songs, ensuring quick access and manipulation.
Provides efficient search, insert, and play operations for the songs.
Dynamic HTML Interface:

Automatically generates an HTML page (ashify.html) that lists all available songs and their corresponding images.
Features a visually appealing design using modern CSS styles, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
Song Management:

Allows users to search for songs using a search bar.
Lists songs with an option to play any song directly by clicking on it.
Displays the currently playing song with its image and name.
Playlist Management:

Users can create custom playlists and add songs to them.
Provides options to play entire playlists, enhancing the listening experience.
Displays songs within a selected playlist and allows users to navigate between them.
Recently Played Songs:

Tracks and displays a list of recently played songs, making it easy for users to replay their favorite tracks.
Technical Details:

Backend (C++):

The core functionality is built in C++, utilizing a splay tree to manage the songs.
Includes key operations like splaying (restructuring the tree based on access patterns), rotations (left and right), insertion, and searching.
Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):

The HTML structure is dynamically generated to include a list of songs and playlist functionalities.
CSS is used for styling to ensure a modern and cohesive look.
JavaScript handles user interactions, such as playing songs, navigating playlists, and searching for tracks.
Usage Instructions:

Building the Project:

Compile the C++ code to generate the HTML file (ashify.html).
Running the Application:

Open the generated ashify.html file in a web browser.
Use the interface to browse, search, and play songs.
Create and manage playlists through the provided controls.
Conclusion:
ASHify offers a robust and interactive platform for music enthusiasts, combining efficient data structure management with a seamless user interface. This project showcases the practical application of splay trees in a real-world scenario, providing both functional and educational value.
